SDLogger is an open source project inspired by Nathan Seidle's OpenLog (http://github.com/nseidle/OpenLog/wiki) to create a simple data logger for full-size high-density SD memory cards.

Ported code:

OpenLog_v1:    Port of OpenLog 1.61 compiled with larger buffer and support for FAT32 and SD cards up to 16GB
OpenLog_v2:    Port of OpenLog 2.2 (not fully functional yet)
fatfs_chan:    Port of ChaN FatFs R0.08a
petit_fatfs:   Port of ChaN petit FatFs R0.02 
arduino-0018:  Core file and SdFat library for arduino-0018
arduino-0021:  Core file and SdFat library for arduino-0021
